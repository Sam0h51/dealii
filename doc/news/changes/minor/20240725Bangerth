Deprecated: ObserverPointer is clearly documented as not owning the
object it points to. Yet, ObserverPointer::clear() deletes the object
pointed to, thereby assuming that the ObserverPointer object actually
owns the object. This must surely be confusing. As a consequence the
function is now deprecated.
