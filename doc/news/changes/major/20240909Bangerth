Changed: The `SmartPointer` class has been renamed to ObserverPointer,
since this name is a much better reflection of the purpose of this
class. The documentation of the class has also been updated
significantly to better explain what the class does.

Correspondingly, the `Subscriptor` class has been renamed to
EnableObserverPointer, since that is what the class actually does.
